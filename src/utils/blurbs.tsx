      Hey there! I'm a soon-to-be software engineer living in Seattle. Welcome
      to my website!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm a fullstack developer with a particular interest in system
      design/development. I love building things—useful applications, extremely
      useless applications, video games, physical devices, water jug art
      installations, and more.&nbsp;

      When I'm not busy wrestling with code or reveling in my five-gallon water
      jug collection, I like to indulge in the finer things in life—debating
      philosophy until 3 AM, juggling, foraging for wild mushrooms, and feeding
      my Alibaba shopping addiction.

      Aside from coding, my other pursuits have included being the cofounder of
      Pineapple Soap Co., president of the&nbsp;
